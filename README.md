# Bioinformagic Messages

Generate completely useless bioinformatics-related loading messages.
Insert into any project to show users just how :sparkles: _advanced_ and 
_clever_ :sparkles: your application is .

Now with generic :sparkles: STP curriculum module names! :sparkles: 

#### Usage for Bioinformatics Messages
